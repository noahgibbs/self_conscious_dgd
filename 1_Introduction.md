# Introduction

I kind of like dynamic, grandiose book titles. If you wanted to write a book called "C++ for the Upstart Philosopher-King" I'd give it a look, you know? Or "Ruby for Rockstars." Neither of these are good ideas. But it's not like "Learn You a Haskell for Great Good" is all about the title, right? A title is meant to get your attention.

And then I realised: here I am writing a book about an ancient dialect of LPC, the language of LPMuds. LPMuds are this ancient text-based MMO from before anybody had processor cycles to burn or a decent network connection. It's hard to even find people who know what an LPMud ***was***. To the few people who remember MUDs, they're kind of a nostalgic joke. And so if I'm out there waving my hands about a grandiose title, it's gonna be kind of embarrassing all around.

So: welcome to Self-Conscious DGD.

It turns out that DGD, specifically, is a kind of cool, weird dynamic language. It's also weird and visionary enough that it went from "ahead of its time" to "what the hell is that?" with no intervening "popular" stage. It had a bizarre history that I'll mostly skip over... But you know the old Doug Engelbart demo, where he basically showed off an alternate version of graphical UIs, a mouse, Instant Messenger and stuff back in the 1960s? DGD is like that, but most of its vision never became real.

Mostly I'm gonna play this book straight. Let's talk about how you'd actually write stuff in DGD. After all, DGD does some things that are ***still*** ahead of its time. I mean, assuming anybody ever figures out how to steal them for a more popular language. We didn't know if it would ever happen with Lisp Macros and it did, right? And Ruby has a few of DGD's better dynamic features. Somebody will steal the rest.

If you learn DGD before that, you can be one of those smug, annoying old programmers who says "oh yeah, I knew about that feature back when all the ways to use it were awful. Let me show you how it's done."

Javascript data inheritance ("prototype inheritance")? LPC was doing it before the rest of the world. Dynamic code reloading? DGD did it before Rails made it common. It had an extensive type-based directory structure before Java and Rails stole that trick. DGD still has a few tricks yet to be stolen. Atomic functions? Somebody will steal them. Caller- and object-name-based security? It'll happen.

You can be the smug grognard for ***those*** features... If you learn now.
