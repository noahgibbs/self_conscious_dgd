# Self-Conscious DGD

This is an attempt at a simple book about Dworkin's Generic Driver, and the dialect of LPC it uses.

It's a book, so mostly you can understand it by just reading the markdown files.

Chapters:

* 1: [Introduction](1_Introduction.md)
* 2: [History of DGD](2_History.md)
* 3: [Setting up DGD](3_SettingUpDGD.md)
* 4: [Why DGD?](4_WhyDGD.md)
* 5: [A Tutorial](5_Tutorial.md)
* 6: [Control Flow in DGD](6_ControlFlow.md)
