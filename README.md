# Self-Conscious DGD

This is an attempt at a simple book about Dworkin's Generic Driver, and the dialect of LPC it uses.

It's a book, so mostly you can understand it by just reading the markdown files.

## License

Frankly, I have no idea how to license the book. I can't imagine it will ever make money, but I like the idea of DGD having an easier approach.

For now, I'm licensing the content as CC-BY-NC (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). In other words, you have to agree that I wrote it, and you can't accept money for it. Other than that, knock yourself out.

I might conceivably relicense later. That won't change your existing rights to existing content, but it may mean future fixes and expansions to the text are under a different license.

Any code in the book, unless already under a different license, may be considered to be CC0 &mdash; effectively public domain. Excerpts from the Kernel Library and Cloud Server are already public domain.

None of my licensing for this book affects the licensing of DGD in any way, of course.
